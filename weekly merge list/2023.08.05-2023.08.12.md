## [feat(apps/gql): handle upvote mutations better & add `PanoPost.isUpvotedByViewer` resolver](https://github.com/kamp-us/monorepo/pull/628)

##Adds a new simple wrapper around `DataLoader` so apps don't use it directly, which gives us a solid extension for the future.

Used this loader, it's not optimized by us, because we delegate it to prisma's own dataloader abstaction by using `prisma.upvote.findUnique`: https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/performance-and-optimization/query-optimization-performance#solving-n1-in-graphql-with-findunique-and-prismas-dataloader

## [feat(apps/gql): change mutation payload types](https://github.com/kamp-us/monorepo/pull/608)

##This is changing the payload types to be more predictable:

before:
```graphql
union CreatePanoPostPayload = PanoPost | NotAuthorized | InvalidInput
```
after:
```graphql
type CreatePanoPostPayload {
  edge: PanoPostEdge
  error: CreatePanoPostError
}

union CreatePanoPostError = NotAuthorized | InvalidInput
```

The reason is that relay wants us to return an edge typed object to be able to update related connections (eg. When a post is added, update the pano feed on pano home page)
